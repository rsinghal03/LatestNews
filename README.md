### Building the project

* Clone the project, the master branch has the latest code.
* This App uses the private api key for getting top news. Get the API key from the [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/)
and put that key in the local.properties file in your project: Your local.properties will look like below:

```
sdk.dir=PATH_TO_ANDROID_SDK_ON_YOUR_LOCAL_MACHINE
apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
```
